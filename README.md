# Bass b00ster in-browser

Bass boost any audio your browser can open: usually those include WAV, AAC, FLAC, MP3, Opus, OGG Vorbis. In-browser, no upload needed. Save result as WAV file.

Developed for latest Chrome (81 as of the time of writing), should also work on others latest ~~Chrome copies~~ Webkit-based browsers (Opera, Edge, whatever). Firefox's preview is messed up (some kind of compression is applied, which prevents hearing bass boost distortions), but the resulting WAV is correct.
