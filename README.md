# Bass b00ster in-browser

**Unleash bass boosting [here: 1valdis.github.io/bass-booster](https://1valdis.github.io/bass-booster/)**

Bass boost any audio your browser can open: usually those include WAV, AAC, FLAC, MP3, Opus, OGG Vorbis. In-browser, no upload needed. Save result as WAV file.

## Why

I was bored during COVID quarantine. Also suitable for meme videos.

## What next

Ideally:

- [ ] Solve Firefox preview issue? ([#1][i1])
- [x] Realtime frequency graph
- [ ] Bass boost specific part of file ?
- [ ] Save as MP3

## Notes

Developed for latest Chrome (81 as of the time of writing), should also work on others latest ~~Chrome copies~~ Webkit-based browsers (Opera, Edge, whatever). Firefox's preview is messed up (some kind of compression is applied, which prevents hearing bass boost distortions), but the resulting WAV is correct.
